## About detection model
* We use [Convolution neural network (CNN) using tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn) to build this model
#### Some problems: 
* The first version of this model is lag on my device while running app, so I must simplify this and I didn't use any pre-trained model. It is why this model has low accuracy.
* It needs to be fine-tuned for better result.
* Can try Vision Transformer instead of using CNN for better result.
